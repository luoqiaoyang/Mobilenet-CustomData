## Mobilenet with custom data

This project uses pytorch to implement Mobilenet with Jupyter Notebook. The main dataset consists of imagenet data and custom data. Hope this could help you to enjoy deep learning.

### Version 1

**Dataset**

Originally, my team select Imagenet 2012 to train the mobilenet model.
