## Mobilenet with custom data

[**Project Home Page**](https://github.com/luoqiaoyang/Mobilenet-CustomData)

The project task is to classify the fruits on supermarkets based on deep CNN model. But the machines in supermarkets only have CPU. So my team select mobilenet as the basic NN model and train it to classify fruits.

This project uses pytorch to implement Mobilenet with Jupyter Notebook. The main dataset consists of imagenet data and custom data. 

Hope this could help you to enjoy deep learning.

### Version 1

**Dataset**

Originally, we select Tiny Imagenet to train the mobilenet model.

### Reference

1. A good pytorch Mobilenet implementation:

2. There are lots of good pytorch tutorials in github, here recommend a Chinese version for new beginners:
